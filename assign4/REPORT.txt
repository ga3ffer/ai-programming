1       ID3 CREDIT DATA
1.1
        The classification tree the ID3 algorithm created, examined the 
        data in the following order: INCOME, HISTORY, DEBT.The tree did 
        not consider the COLLATERAL property in constructing the 
        decision tree.
1.2           
        The total number of combinations of credit data depend on how 
        the ID3 algorithm constructs the tree. In this instance since 
        COLLATERAL in not included in the tree and it does not consider 
        it a property when making decisions, the total number of 
        combinations is, 3! for income, 3! for history, and 2! for debt.
        Total combinations = 3!*3!*2! = 72 different combinations.
        If COLLATERAL was considered it would equal: 
        3!*3!*2!*2! = 144 different combinations.
1.3
        Here are the 10 new, unique credit date instances:

;;;; 10 new instances of credit data
(history . bad)    (debt . high)(collateral . none)    (income . over-35k)   - moderate
(history . bad)    (debt . low) (collateral . adequate)(income . 0-to-15k)   - high
(history . bad)    (debt . low) (collateral . none)    (income . over-35k)   - moderate
(history . good)   (debt . high)(collateral . adequate)(income . 15k-to-35k) - moderate

(history . unknown)(debt . low) (collateral . adequate)(income . 15k-to-35k) - moderate

        I classified each instance in the current data set making no 
        modifications to ID3-credit-data-orig.lisp. To the right I 
        labeled each instance with the corresponding risk value,
        via running the classify function in ID3-luger-orig.lisp.

        In adding the 10 new animal instances, I was surprised to see 
        that the number of top level clusters did not change. 
  
        There remains three main clusters:

C-8406{PANGOLIN MEERKAT CAMEL NARWHAL IBEX GIBBON HEDGEHOG ELEPHANT BEAR LION PANTHER} ; no-fly live-birth no-web
C-8404{QUETZAL EAGLE GRACKLE ROBIN} ; feathers fly no-swim beak eggs wings no-web
C-8405{PLATYPUS DUCK PENGUIN} ; swim beak eggs

        The first cluster (C-8406) with notable change and the other two 
        (C-8404,C8405) classified the same, only different is the 
        addition of QUETZAL, and PLATYPUS, respectively. All other new 
        animal instances created were grouped in cluster C-8406.
        In reviewing the results I can conclude that C-8406 is a 
        mammalian cluster, evident by the properties common to this 
        cluster: no-fly live-birth no-web.
        I would also agree that the sub/child clusters in the group do 
        make logical sense.

        I created a domain of engines. The characteristics I used for 
        domain instances are stroke cycle, number of cylinders, engine 
        layout, cubic centimetre range, horsepower, revolutions per 
        minute, and torque. Typically engines are classified by first 
        the stroke cycle: two vs four, then the cylinder configuration: 
        straight, v, boxer, etc... All other characteristic of and 
        engine are derived from those two important properties.

        In creating this domain, I wanted to see how the COBWEB 
        algorithm clustered the engine instances I created. I was 
        surprised by the results. It did not classify the engines the 
        way they are normally are.

        COBWEB created three main clusters:
          C-7580{TURBINE V8 RC211V 2S-PARALLEL-TWIN BOXER-SIX BOXER-FOUR IN-LINE-SIX IN-LINE-FOUR IN-LINE-TRIPLE} ; high-rpm high-hp
          C-7578{DIESEL BOXER-TWO V-TWIN-FOUR V-TWIN IN-LINE-PARALLEL} ; medium-hp
          C-7579{ROTARY WANKEL 2S-SINGLE SINGLE-CYLINDER}
              
        It grouped together instances which shared a common property 
        first, then creating child clusters, and finally grouping the 
        four instances with least likability in a cluster of their own.
